# Gentoo Install

Various scripts that I have created during the years (som are outdated)

### install.sh

*   Script for setup Gentoo, do not run this script before you modify it. It may fuck your current system, you have been warned.
   The script is almost just a copy-by-paste script for install gentoo untill chroot, this includes your setup to be fully
   encrypted by twofish-xts-plain64 cipher with a keyfile on ~8MB and require keyfile on boot via an removable device.

*   This script is not recommended to use for newbies, it has been created for myself whenever I would use t6his script again (there is better scrips/setups in this repo, if not stay tuned I will add more stuff to this repo - Added this: 2021-10-12)
